# Project Summary 

The Management Team at Walt Disney wants to improve its Customer Service and is looking for an analytical solution that could provide an in-depth analysis of customer's Reviews Data of the given three Disney Theme Parks.
The aim of the project is to develop a Business Solution based on the Sentiment Analysis that would help the Management Team to focus only on Concerns, Interests and improve its facilities and Services.
To achieve the above aim, we have performed Data Exploration to find out the Peak Time to visit each Theme park, their highest average Ratings, Major groups of Visitors etc.

Walt Disney provided with a sample of approximately 42,000 reviews, posted by visitors to a popular travel review platform (TripAdvisor). 

The data include the following information:

•Review_ID. 
•Rating: ranging from 1 (unsatisfied) to 5 (satisfied). 
•Year_Month: when the reviewer visited the theme park. 
•Reviewer_Location: country of origin of visitor. 
•Review_Text: comments made by visitor. 
•Branch: location of Disneyland Park.
